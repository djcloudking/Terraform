**Deploying an E-commerce Website on AWS Using Terraform**


### Prerequisites

##### If this is your first time using terraform, follow these steps:

1. **Install Terraform**: Set up Terraform on your local machine to automate your infrastructure using code.

2. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Set up a repository for version control and collaborative development of your Terraform code.

3. **Install Git**: Install Git to manage your code and collaborate effectively.

4. **Generate Key Pairs**: Create key pairs for secure access to your AWS instances.

5. **Create an IAM User and Named Profile**: Set up an IAM user and a named profile for programmatic access to AWS.

6. **Install Visual Studio Code**: Use this code editor for writing and managing Terraform configurations.

7. **Add Terraform Extensions**: Enhance Visual Studio Code by adding Terraform-specific extensions.

8. **Install AWS CLI on Windows**: Set up the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your machine for easy communication with AWS services.

9. **Configure a Named Profile for AWS CLI**: Set up a named profile to simplify authentication with AWS.

10. **Create an S3 Bucket for Terraform State**: Set up an S3 bucket to securely store the Terraform state file, ensuring consistency across deployments.

##### If you have used Terraform in the past, skip to 10. 


### Infrastructure Deployment


1. **Authenticate to AWS**: Use your AWS CLI named profile to authenticate and manage AWS services programmatically.

2. **Create a VPC**: Define and provision a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Terraform to isolate and secure your resources.

3. **Set Up a NAT Gateway**: Use Terraform to create a NAT gateway, enabling outbound internet access for resources in private subnets.

4. **Create a Security Group**: Define and apply a security group using Terraform to control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances.

5. **Set Up RDS**: Use Terraform to configure an AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) for efficient and scalable database management.

6. **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Use Terraform to provision an ALB, which will distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets to ensure high availability.

7. **Set Up an SNS Topic**: Implement Terraform to configure an AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic for event-driven messaging.

8. **Create an Auto Scaling Group**: Use Terraform to create an Auto Scaling Group, which will dynamically adjust your instance count based on traffic demand.

9. **Configure a Record Set in Route 53**: Use Terraform to set up a record set in AWS Route 53 for domain management and DNS resolution.
