## Scenario

Fahmacloud has designed a blueprint for a prototype payroll software that needs to be deployed across multiple countries. Each country will have its own instance deployed on the AWS cloud, utilizing the same architecture. The goal is to replicate the infrastructure using the same technology stack for deployments in different countries.
