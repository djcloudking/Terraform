# Terraform

This repo is for showing Infrastructure as Code resources creation using Terraform

Terraform is generally used for: 

1. Greenfield deployment

1. Datacenter Migration (Landing Zone)

1. Deploy/Destroy On-demand resources (IaaS/PaaS)

1. Horizontal scaling (add more resources)

Here you will find all the side projects I worked on.
